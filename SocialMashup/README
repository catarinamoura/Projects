This assignment focused on implementing social media features into a website, created by us. The main goal is to understand how everything is implemented and the implementation methods between the different social medias.


Everything (inter-dependencies) is explained in more detail below.

Files List
------------
The included files are the following:


- index.html → file containing the homepage of the website. Contains a google +1 button, Like and Send (FB) buttons along with a comment area, where people can share their thoughts on the website. Additionally the user can login and logout from the facebook.


- contact.html → contains the implementation of the google maps, showing our place of contact on the map (and our contacts information)


- friends.php  → implements a map that contains (on it), five friends' posts and its locations.


- post.php → implementation of the push feature to Facebook. Here you can either add a photo to your Facebook wall (creating an album)


- pull.php → implements the functions needed to take information from facebook, in this case (after logged in) we access the person’s name, birthday, email, facebook link and their academic journey.


- wallpost.php → its goal is to implement the function of posting a facebook comment and redirecting it to Facebook. 


- youtube.html → create a video and upload to YouTube where you can start, cancel, restart and review the record before upload .


Stylesheets
- style.css → Defines the colors, margins, etc to define the basic style of the webpage.


- reset.css → Reduces browsers inconsistencies. 


HOW IT WORKS
-------------------

Opening our site in a browser, it redirects to our home page. There you can see many tabs:


1. Home
With the basic social media features, like FB button and +1 google button in order to like the page. There’s also the Send FB button, so that we can recommend/ send the link of this website to a Facebook friend.
There is also a comment area, where the viewer can comment (if properly logged in facebook).
At the end we did to o the login and logout button.



2. Contact
This area contains the developers’ information, names and emails. It also contains a map (google maps) with the exact location of the developers. 


3. Pull
It shows the user’s information (provided by facebook).
(If properly logged in Facebook)

A photo can be added to an Album (created by our application) on Facebook. 
You can also add a comment on facebook via our application.
