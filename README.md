Projects
========

Some projects I have developed during the academic year 2012/2013

 - In the folder Cryptosystem it is possible to find three projects:

1. Folder AES - Implements the AES-128 block cipher encryption function

2. Folder OCB - Implements the offset code book (OCB) mode for AES-128 block cipher.

3. Folder Grostl-256 - Implements Grøstl-256 hash function. Grøstl is one of the five finalists of the ongoing SHA-3 hash function competition and it can very well become the next "AES" of hash functions.

- Folder Hadoop_pig - Solved exercises with pig

- Folder Network_Management - Set an enterprise network

- Folder SocialMashup - Dynamic web application which pull and push information from social media services.

- Folder XML- XML Schema for a library
